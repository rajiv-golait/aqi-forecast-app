# üå¨Ô∏è AQI Forecast App

A production-ready machine learning system for forecasting Air Quality Index (AQI) across India, using real-time government and weather data, advanced ML models, and a robust API backend.

---

## üöÄ Hackathon Context
This project is designed for a hackathon challenge: **Developing an Algorithm for Air Quality Visualizer and Forecast App to Generate Granular, Real-time, and Predictive Air Quality Information**.

- **Goal:** Deliver hyperlocal, real-time, and predictive AQI insights for both large cities and underserved regions.
- **Features:**
  - Real-time AQI from ground stations
  - Historical AQI trends
  - 24‚Äì72h AQI forecasting using meteorological data
  - Health recommendations
  - (Optional) Push alerts, pollution source mapping

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Pipeline Workflow

1. **Data Fetching:** Download and merge AQI and weather data from government APIs.
2. **Model Training:** Train ensemble ML models on historical data.
3. **Forecast Generation:** Predict AQI for the next 3 days for all stations.
4. **Incremental Forecasting:** Update 1-hour-ahead AQI forecasts for all stations every hour.
5. **API Serving:** Serve real-time, historical, and forecast AQI via FastAPI.
6. **Automation:** Orchestrator script automates all steps and logs job status.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
# Python 3.8+
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd aqi-forecast-app
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Also install the scheduler dependency:
pip install schedule
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Fetching

Fetch and merge all available AQI and weather data:
```bash
python scripts/fetch_and_merge_all_data.py
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training

Train the ensemble ML model:
```bash
python scripts/train_ensemble_model.py
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Forecast Generation

Generate 3-day AQI forecasts:
```bash
python scripts/predict_3day_aqi.py
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Incremental Forecasting

Update 1-hour-ahead AQI forecasts for all stations (run hourly):
```bash
python scripts/incremental_forecast.py
```
- This script is automatically scheduled by the orchestrator to run every hour (at :05).

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ API Server

Start the FastAPI server to serve predictions:
```bash
python -m api.main
# or
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Automation & Orchestration

Run the orchestrator to automate all backend jobs:
```bash
python run_backend_orchestrator.py
```
- Starts API server, schedules data fetch, **incremental forecast (hourly)**, 3-day forecast (daily), and model retraining (every 3 days).
- Logs job status to `logs/orchestrator_job_status.csv` (timestamp, job, status, error)

---

## üîë API Usage
- All endpoints require an API key (see `/register` endpoint).
- Pass your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header.
